# Experiment 1 — Setup & Hello Compose

This folder contains a minimal skeleton for Experiment 1: a Jetpack Compose "Hello Compose" application written in Kotlin.

What this is:
- A minimal `app` module with a Compose `MainActivity` and AndroidManifest.
- Placeholder Gradle files (`build.gradle.kts`, `app/build.gradle.kts`) with typical Compose dependencies.

Important notes before building:
1. This skeleton does not include an Android Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`). Use Android Studio to open the `experiment_1/` folder — Android Studio will configure the recommended Gradle plugin and can generate the wrapper for you.
2. Ensure you have the Android SDK and Kotlin plugin installed via Android Studio.

How to run (recommended via Android Studio):
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Choose "Open" and select the `c:\Users\abhay\temp\MAD\experiment_1` folder.
3. Allow Android Studio to sync Gradle, suggest plugin versions, and (optionally) generate the Gradle wrapper.
4. Run the `app` configuration on an emulator or device.

Optional: command-line build (PowerShell)
- After you have a Gradle wrapper in place (generated by Android Studio or `gradle wrapper`), run in PowerShell from `experiment_1`:

```powershell
.\gradlew assembleDebug
```

If you prefer I can:
- generate a Gradle wrapper here (if you want) — note: this may not fully succeed in this environment; or
- attempt a `./gradlew` run and report the output.
